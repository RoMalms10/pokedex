# Simple Pokedex

## To use this Pokedex:
1. Run the rails app (this app uses postgres)
    a. rails db:create
    b. rails db:migrate
    c. rails s

2. Navigate to localhost:3000
3. Click on "Register a new pokemon"
4. Type in a valid Pokemon name (i.e. bulbasaur)
5. See information about the pokemon


Once a pokemon has been registered (meaning that you've caught one) you don't need to type it in again, you can easily go back to the Pokedex Entries and click on the pokemon again and the same information will pop up.
